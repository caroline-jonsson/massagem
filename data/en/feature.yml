  title: The Benefits of Massage
  content: The most common feedback I get is clients discovering their body
    through the massage. Sometimes we feel tension or pain in one part of the
    body when the source of it is in a different location. Sometimes we are not
    tuned into all parts of our body. Sometimes we won’t notice our tension
    until someone else starts to release it.
