      title: Respect
      content: "Receiving a massage from an unknown person is a vulnerable situation
        where one can feel nervous and exposed. As a massage therapist I am
        aware of this and will do my absolute best to make you feel comfortable
        and relaxed so that you can get the most out of the treatment. I will
        always respect your boundaries and privacy. To me, hygiene and
        cleanliness is also a matter of respect and ethics: towels are always
        washed, the massage bed disinfected and my hands clean."

      title: Professionalism
      content: To me being professional is knowing what I can do, but also knowing
        when not to massage or what I cannot treat. The combination of
        theoretical knowledge about the body, practical knowledge from
        experience and curiosity in your specific unique body is the basis of
        all massages and treatments I do. And presence, always presence.

      title: Sensitivity
      content: Especially for people who themselves have training and knowledge about
        the body and treatment, or a lot of experience receiving massages, it
        can be very challenging to find someone who can do what they wish for. I
        know from experience and therefore try to be extra sensitive and
        receptive to those needs.
